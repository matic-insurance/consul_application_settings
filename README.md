Gem that simplifies usage of Consul (via [Diplomat gem](https://github.com/WeAreFarmGeek/diplomat)) 
to host application settings. Gem provides defaults via yaml files and other utilities 
to simplify storage and control of application with Consul KV storage.

Gem is trying to solve a problem of distributing application settings for local development environment and provide defaults 
in production before custom value is set inside of consul. 

Example use cases:

- One engineer has created a new feature that depend on consul key/value. 
  
  How enginner can notify other engineers that they need to set this value in their consul environments?

- DevOps team responsible to configure and maintain deployment. 

  How do they learn (have reference) of what settings and structure application expect? 

Gem reads any particular setting from consul and if it is missing tries to find value in YAML defaults file
